# Problem Set 1

## Problem 1
* Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
* Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. 

Test Case: 
```
s = 'azcbobobegghakl'
```
should print:
```
Number of vowels: 5
```

## Problem 2
* Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
* Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s.

Test Case: 
```
s = 'azcbobobegghakl'
```
should print:
```
Number of times bob occurs is: 2
```


## Problem 3
* Assume s is a string of lower case characters.
* Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. 

Test Case: 
```
s = 'azcbobobegghakl'
```
should print:
```
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
```
* In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if:
```
s = 'abcbcd'
```
then should print:
```
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
```
