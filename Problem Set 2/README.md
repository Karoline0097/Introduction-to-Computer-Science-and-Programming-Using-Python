# Problem Set 2

## Problem 1 - Paying Debt off in a Year
* Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month.

* The following variables contain values as described below:

1. balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card

2. annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

3. monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal

* For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance. At the end of 12 months, print out the remaining balance. Be sure to print out no more than two decimal digits of accuracy.
* Required Formulas:
> Monthly interest rate= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
> Minimum monthly payment = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)
> Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)
> Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)

* Test Case:
```
balance = 42
annualInterestRate = 0.2
monthlyPaymentRate = 0.04
```
Result Your Code Should Generate Below:
```
Remaining balance: 31.38
```
To make sure you are doing calculation correctly, this is the 
remaining balance you should be getting at each month for this example:
```
Month 1 Remaining balance: 40.99
Month 2 Remaining balance: 40.01
Month 3 Remaining balance: 39.05
Month 4 Remaining balance: 38.11
Month 5 Remaining balance: 37.2
Month 6 Remaining balance: 36.3
Month 7 Remaining balance: 35.43
Month 8 Remaining balance: 34.58
Month 9 Remaining balance: 33.75
Month 10 Remaining balance: 32.94
Month 11 Remaining balance: 32.15
Month 12 Remaining balance: 31.38
